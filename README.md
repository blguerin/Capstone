# Capstone
A web app submitted as a capstone assignment for Object Oriented Programming and Design Patterns course at Algonquin College. Focused on user handling and design pattern implementation, but has grown beyond these requirements.

## DrawnToYou
### The Concept
DrawnToYou is an art sharing social media platform focusing on portraiture. It allows a user to upload a profile picture that other users may feel inspired to recreate artistically. Users may submit their creations to be hosted by DrawnToYou. A user's profile page will showcase their profile picture and a piece of art (of the user's choosing) based off of their profile picture. The profile page also showcases two image reels, one of which highlights that user's creations, the other showing art that has been inspired by that user.
